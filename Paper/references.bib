abstract="Random Forests were introduced by Leo Breiman [6] who was inspired by earlier work by Amit and Geman [2]. Although not obvious from the description in [6], Random Forests are an extension of Breiman's bagging idea [5] and were developed as a competitor to boosting. Random Forests can be used for either a categorical response variable, referred to in [6] as ``classification,'' or a continuous response, referred to as ``regression.'' Similarly, the predictor variables can be either categorical or continuous.",

abstract = {Abstract An open question in empirical economics is whether models should be estimated by using the actual, or linear, values of economic variables or their logarithms. This paper applies the principle of encompassing to suggest specification and mis-specification tests of log vs. linear individual equations fitted to I(1) data, and illustrates the analysis for US quarterly disposable income. The finite-sample properties of the encompassing tests are examined in a Monte Carlo experiment customized to the parameter values found in the empirical analysis.},
